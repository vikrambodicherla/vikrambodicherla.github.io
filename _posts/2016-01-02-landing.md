title: About me
---

I've been doing Android for over 5 years now. I've worked on a variety of apps from photo organization to videos to launchers to finance. 

I have a Masters in Science (Computer Science) from [University of California, Irvine](http://ics.uci.edu) and a Bachelors of Engineering (Hons.), Computer Science from [BITS, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/ComputerScience).

On the personal front, I've been married happily for 6 years now. I have 2 young kids, both less than 5 years old, so life involves schedules and a lot of running around.

### What I enjoy doing in my free time
* I read a lot! I am now working through Isaac Asimov's series
* I like building things - I just got an Arduino which will soon be managing my vertical blinds. I want to program it to open my blinds from 30 min before sunrise, slowly.
* I've just started learning the Violin. I've been wanting to play the Violin for ever.
* I also got an [Amazon Echo Dot](https://goo.gl/xWmyJG) recently and am trying to wire everything up to it by having things emulate Belkin devices.
