### About me
I am a father of 2 young kids, happily married since 2010, enjoy playing the Violin and have loved every job I've had!

I currently work on Uber's Rider experience, primarily on the Android rider app. I've been a full-stack'ish engineer mostly, but have primarily been doing Android for over 7 years now - from photo organization to launchers to finance apps to Uber now. I've also managed teams of engineers, most recently as a Sr. Manager of Engineering at Yahoo Finance.

I have strong opinions on the evolution of the place technology in society, especially within young families.
