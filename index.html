<p>I've been doing Android for over 5 years now. I've worked on a variety of apps from photo organization to videos to launchers to finance. </p>

<p>I have a Masters in Science (Computer Science) from <a href="http://ics.uci.edu">University of California, Irvine</a> and a Bachelors of Engineering (Hons.), Computer Science from <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/ComputerScience">BITS, Pilani</a>.</p>

<p>On the personal front, I've been married happily for 6 years now. I have 2 young kids, both less than 5 years old, so life involves schedules and a lot of running around.</p>

<ul>
<li>I read a lot! I am now working through Isaac Asimov's series</li>
<li>I like building things - I just got an Arduino which will soon be managing my vertical blinds. I want to program it to open my blinds from 30 min before sunrise, slowly.</li>
<li>I've just started learning the Violin. I've been wanting to play the Violin for ever.</li>
